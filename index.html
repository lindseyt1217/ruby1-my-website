    <h1>LINDSEY TRIEU</h1>
    <h2>Vegan. Minimalist. And one day, a world traveler. (But for now...) Wanderlust.</h2>
    <p>I am a lost soul trying to find my place in the world.</p>
    <h4>A glimpse into my life.</h4>
    <p>I am a first generation American, born and raised in the city of St. Louis. I have one older brother and one older step sister. I live with my mom and stepdad.</p>
    <h4>My dreams and aspirations.</h4>
    <p>I plan on becoming a trauma surgeon and specializing in cardiovascular surgery. Before that however, I will graduate high school and attend West Point. After that I will attend USUHS (Uniformed Servies University of Health Sciences) and serve in the military for about 15 years as a doctor. After my service, I will be a trauma surgeon. Along with these goals, I plan to travel the world and spread a positive message to all that I meet about veganism.</p>
    <h4>My passions and hobbies.</h4>
    <p>I am extremely passionate about veganism and good health. I also enjoy excercising and running. I have done many races such as 5ks and half marathons. </p>
